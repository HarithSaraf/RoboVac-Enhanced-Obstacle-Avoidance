## <samp>Introduction</samp>
<samp>Traditional robotic vacuum cleaners often encounter challenges when navigating around obstacles such as jwellery, faeces , leading to inefficient cleaning and potential collisions. To address these limitations, this project combines  YOLO-v5 object detection and localization algorithm in addition to the Lidar technology to enhance the robot's ability to detect and avoid obstacles with high accuracy.<br>
Moreover, the project goes beyond simple obstacle avoidance by implementing a complete path coverage algorithm. This algorithm generates optimal cleaning paths, ensuring that the robotic vacuum cleaner covers the entire cleaning area systematically and efficiently. The project also includes a real-time monitoring module, which provides visual feedback on the cleaning process, obstacle detection, and path coverage progress.<br> 
By leveraging the capabilities of YOLO-v5, Lidar, and the CPP algorithm, the project aims to improvise the obstacle avoidance which inturn would improve the efficiency of the robot in cleaning spaces.</samp>

## <samp>Configuration</samp>
<samp>
The Enhanced Obstacle Avoidance System can be easily customized to accommodate various environments and types of robotic vacuum cleaners. To tailor the system's behavior according to your specific needs, you can access the configuration options and parameters in the "config" directory of this repository.
<br>
To make adjustments, simply modify the relevant configuration files based on your requirements. After making any changes, it is important to rebuild the ROS2 packages to ensure that the system incorporates your customized settings effectively.
